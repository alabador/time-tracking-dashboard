# time-tracking-dashboard
A small project to track time spent on tasks, used to practice React skills.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, CSS, Javascript

I used this project to focus on learning the fundamentals of React.js. I kept the CSS vanilla for now, to minimize learning too many things at once and any potential complications. 

## Optimizations

In creating the toggle feature for the timeframe selection on the profile card, I created three separate states. I'm sure there's definitely a way to improve the logic of switching active states between elements, but with my current knowledge of React, I used what worked.

Next features I would like to implement (TBD):
- Modal on click to add time to existing data (json)
- Move data from a local json file to MongoDB to create a fullstack app.

## Lessons Learned

I learned a lot about how React works, using JSX, passing props between parent and child components, state, and conditional rendering.
